          <p>
           
            About seven million Nepalese youths are out of the country for foreign employment in the different parts of the world simply because of the lack of employment opportunities in the country. There are several reasons for this devastating situation, and one of them is the visionless government policy and programs that could not create employment opportunities for the youth. Next, working men and women in different sectors – government, agriculture, health, education, tourism, formal and non-formal sectors, etc – are totally frustrated because of ‘red tape’ and highly corrupted systems as practiced by the government. Similarly, senior citizens, who are at their ‘third age’ of retired life from their respective contributions to the nation, are spending their lives in miserable, depressed, and contemptible/unrespected situations and circumstances.
</p>
<p><b>
“Red tape is an idiom that refers to excessive regulation or rigid conformity to formal rules that is considered redundant and hinders action or decision-making. It is usually applied to governments, corporations, and other large organizations”
</b></p>
<p>
  <b>
In this context, a novel concept of the University of Three Generations (U-3Gs) is emerged in Nepal incorporating a broader aim of empowering and involving three generations: youth, working men and women, and groups of senior citizens to lead and transform the society towards Nepal’s prosperity.
